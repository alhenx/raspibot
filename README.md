# RaspiBOT R3B0RN
Raspibot is a Telegram's Bot to control your Raspberry Pi and keep in contact with it.

## Versions

 - v2.0 "Dawn of RaspiBOT" 
 - v1.0.1 "Cabashito Carmes√≠" https://github.com/alhenx/raspibot/tree/raspibot_old (UNMAINTAINED).
 
## Installation
To install RaspiBOT, you only need to execute our setup Bash script (we not recomend using PuTTY to log in to SSH, as we use 'dialog' and stuff goes weird):

```sh
$ bash <(curl -sL git.io/vSdkW)
```
